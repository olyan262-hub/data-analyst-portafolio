# SQL Customer Support Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer support ticket data to evaluate team performance, SLA compliance, and operational efficiency.  
The goal is to extract actionable insights using advanced SQL queries commonly used in real-world analytics roles.

---

## 🗂 Dataset
The dataset (`tickets.csv`) contains simulated customer support tickets with the following fields:

- ticket_id  
- created_at  
- resolved_at  
- category  
- priority  
- agent  
- response_time_hours  
- status

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- SQL (Advanced queries)
- SQLite (SQLite Online)
- CSV data handling

---

## 📊 Key Analyses
The project includes the following analyses:

1. Monthly ticket volume trends  
2. SLA breach percentage (response time > 8 hours)  
3. Agent efficiency ranking using window functions  
4. Top 3 most efficient agents  
5. High-priority tickets by category  
6. Average resolution time per agent  

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window Functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER)
- Conditional aggregation (CASE WHEN)
- KPI calculation (SLA breach rate)
- Time-based analysis

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open https://sqliteonline.com  
2. Import `tickets.csv` as a table named `tickets`  
3. Run the queries located in `queries/advanced_analysis.sql`
